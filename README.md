# CppSuite - A Suite of Helpful C++ Tools
## Getting Started

Follow these steps to build and use these C++ tools.

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (I used g++)
- (Optional) VSCode (or any other text editor, like Notepad++) to look through the files

### Building

Just run this command:

```bash
g++ src/tool_folder/main.cpp src/tool_folder/tool.cpp -o build/tool_name
```

*Replace 'tool_folder' and 'tool.cpp' with the name of the tool you're building. On the output of the command, replace tool_name with whatever you want the output .exe to be called--the .exe extension is automatically added on by G++.*

#### **Optional, but rccommended**

- You can add this to your system's PATH to make it work without changing directory into the build folder.

## Usage

- For ```getOS_Type```, just type in the name of your compiled exe to run it (Powershell was being weird for me, and I had to run .\getOS_Version.exe).
